## Features

### 📋 Pokédex with Tracking
- Browse all **211 Pokémon** available in FireRed & LeafGreen — full Kanto Dex (1–151) plus every non-Kanto species with an in-game encounter
- Mark each Pokémon as **caught** — progress is saved locally in your browser
- Cry audio plays when you mark a Pokémon as caught
- Filter by **FireRed-only**, **LeafGreen-only**, or both version exclusives
- Switch between **Kanto Dex** (151) and **National Dex** (all 211) views
- Progress bar shows how much of the active dex you've caught

### 🔍 Per-Pokémon Detail Panel

## Data Sources

- Encounter data, learnsets, stats, and Pokédex entries are fetched from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- TM/HM compatibility, version exclusives, and manual encounter data are curated by hand for FRLG accuracy
- All data is **Gen 3 specific** — types (no Fairy), moves, and learnsets reflect FireRed & LeafGreen

npm run dev

# Re-fetch Pokémon data from PokéAPI (~2–3 min, rate-limited)
